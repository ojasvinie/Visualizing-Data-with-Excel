# Visualizing-Data-with-Excel

In this project,I worked on a data visualization using the Bike Buyers dataset in Microsoft Excel to analyze customer demographics and their influence on bike purchasing behavior. The dataset included details such as gender, age, income, education, marital status, commute distance, and car ownership. I began by cleaning and organizing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Then, I used PivotTables to summarize key patterns and created various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and stacked column charts to represent the insights clearly. I also added slicers to make the dashboard interactive. Through this analysis, I observed that individuals with higher incomes, fewer cars, and moderate commute distances were more likely to purchase bikes. This project helped me apply Excelâ€™s analytical tools to uncover trends and present findings in a visually engaging and meaningful way.
